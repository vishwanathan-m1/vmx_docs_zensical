Super Apps and Micro Apps
===========================
This document outlines how micro apps streamline development, simplify maintenance, and enhance code reuse, enabling the creation of super apps that drive greater agility, productivity, and long-term efficiency.

## Micro Apps

Microapps are single-purpose applications designed to perform a specific task quickly and efficiently. Like microservices, they are lightweight, modular, and reusable.

While they support rich media and moderately complex functions, they are faster and easier to develop than traditional web or multiexperience applications.

## Super Apps

A super app is a web or mobile application that offers core features and provides access to independently developed microapps. It functions as a platform, creating an ecosystem of modular, task-specific microapps.

## Key Benefits

<b>Increased developer productivity</b>

Microapps enable smaller, focused development efforts. Breaking development into smaller tasks, optimizes resource allocation, and enables teams to work on different apps-in parallel, reducing dependencies and accelerating delivery.

<b>Simplified maintenance</b>

Micro app strategies increase the impact of Agile development teams in both app development and ongoing support. They simplify patching, enable easy feature additions, and streamline debugging.

<b>Improved code consistency and reuse</b>

Building micro apps follows a defined architectural pattern, allowing developers to expand the existing codebase without needing to decipher previous work. This approach also facilitates the reuse of micro app components across applications. Additionally, the reference architecture establishes security and data protection requirements through ecosystem governance, supported by shared platform capabilities.
