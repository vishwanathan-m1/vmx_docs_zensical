With the introduction of Live Activities in Volt Iris from iOS 16.2, developers now have access to the Live Activities, enabling the creation of streamlined and glanceable user interactions. Notably, from iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models, Live Activities make optimal use of the Dynamic Island's expansive display capabilities. 

Live Activities showcase the latest data from your app directly on the iPhone or iPad Lock Screen and within the Dynamic Island. This feature enables users to quickly view real-time information and take immediate actions relevant to the displayed content. Live Activities offer a concise and immersive method to monitor event progress or task status. They are characterized by a defined start and end, facilitating real-time updates either through background app runtime or remotely via Push Notifications.
