# Import Figma Design into Volt Iris

This feature enables developers and designers to import Figma designs into Volt Iris using artificial intelligence (AI). It uses advanced AI to map designs to Iris-compatible widgets accurately.

**Prerequisites**

* Install **Python 3.12.x** on your computer. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Install **the Figma desktop application**. [Download Figma](https://www.figma.com/downloads/).
* Install **VoltMX Figma to Iris Form** plugin in Figma. [Download Plugin](https://my.hcltechsw.com/downloads/voltmx/utilities).

## Setting Up the Environment

### Set Up the VoltMX Figma to Iris Plugin in Figma

Follow these steps to set up the plugin:

1. <a name="step1"></a>Unzip the downloaded **VoltMX Figma to Iris** `.zip` file to a preferred location on your computer.
2. Open the **Figma desktop application**, and open the Figma design file you want to use.
3. Right-click an empty area of the canvas, and select **Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest…**.

    *This plugin allows you to export design frames as `.zip` files compatible with Volt Iris.*
>**Important:** This plugin is compatible only with Figma **Design** files. It does not support **FigJam**, **Slides**, or any other Figma file types. Ensure you are using a Design file to access the plugin’s functionality.

### Set Up the Python Environment in Volt Iris

Follow these steps to set up the Python Environment:

1. Open **Volt Iris**.
2. Go to **Preferences > Figma > General**.

## macOS First-Time Setup Warning ⚠️

When you use **Import Figma Form** for the first time on macOS, the import may fail due to security restrictions on native Python extensions (such as *pydantic*). A pop-up like the one shown below may appear.

>**Note:** The exact message and behavior may vary depending on your macOS version.

### To resolve this issue:

1. Select **OK** on the pop-up.

    *Once approved, future imports will proceed without interruption.*

    >**Disclaimer:** The **Figma to Iris** feature uses AI to convert your designs into Iris forms. While this can significantly speed up your workflow, AI-generated outputs may contain occasional inaccuracies. We recommend reviewing the form's structure, hierarchy, and design elements carefully before finalizing or using the converted form.
