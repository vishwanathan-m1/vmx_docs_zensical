## Volt Iris

### Import Figma designs into Volt Iris

Volt Iris now lets you import Figma designs directly as forms, eliminating the need to recreate them manually.

Using the new Figma plugin available in My HCLSoftware (MHS) Utilities for Volt Iris, you can easily export Figma designs in a format compatible with Volt Iris, including all embedded assets.

This AI-powered conversion enables a smooth transition from Figma to Volt Iris. While results may vary depending on the design's complexity, you can use any Figma library or template in your original design.

### Conversational RAG with Volt AI in Volt IQ

RAG-enhanced Volt AI uses a comprehensive and continuously updated training dataset to generate detailed responses to your queries and create on-demand code snippets you can use in your application.

If you provide feedback, Volt AI can use it to improve the model’s accuracy over time.

### Redesigned Interface in Volt Iris

The Volt Iris IDE now features a redesigned interface that improves ease of use, feature discoverability, accessibility, and visual consistency.

This update introduces several quality-of-life enhancements, such as clearer fonts, improved contrast, and easier access to deeply nested data. Core functionality remains unchanged.

These changes are designed to streamline your workflow and enhance overall productivity.

### Modernized Widget Library and Auto-Generated Form Templates

The widget library has been refreshed with a modern visual theme based on current design standards. 

Form templates auto-generated from service definitions have also been updated to align with the new visual style.

You can now build visually consistent, professional-looking apps without applying custom styles to built-in design elements.


### Enhanced Error Detection and Reporting in the Action Editor

The Action Editor now provides detailed, context-specific error messages to help you identify and resolve design issues more easily.

### Support for iOS Live Activities

Volt Iris now supports Live Activities on iOS 16.2 and later, enabling real-time updates on the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island. 

This provides a less obtrusive alternative to traditional notifications.

You can start, update, or end Live Activities directly from the app or remotely through push notifications.

### Native Support for Apple Silicon Macs

Volt Iris IDE now runs natively on Apple Silicon Macs, with no dependency on the Rosetta framework.

Users can choose between the x86 or Apple Silicon version of Volt Iris, based on their Mac development environment.

## Volt Foundry

### Governance Features

Volt Foundry now lets you monitor and control deployment requests for any runtime environments where Governance is enabled.

When enabled, all requests, such as service definition updates or unpublishing to business-critical environments are subject to manual review by designated approvers or administrators before they go live.

Governance ensures that changes to your application runtimes are secure, traceable, and auditable.
