Preface
=======

Volt Foundry captures a set of standard metrics and provides a set of APIs for capturing custom metrics and events. This data is processed and stored in a relational data model that can be analyzed by any business intelligence (BI) or reporting engine. HCL provides a set of standard reports for TIBCO Software’s Jaspersoft BI server that can help you analyze and report on this data, and even design your own custom reports. The results of these reports can be viewed in various chart types or exported to PDF, Excel, or a comma separated value (CSV) file.

For successful configuration with reports database, and to access data sources of Volt Foundry, HCL recommends that you follow the below order to install Volt Foundry features for on-premises:

*   Install all components such as, Volt Foundry Console, Volt Foundry Identity, and Volt MX Integration Service. For more details, refer to the [Volt Foundry Installation Guides](./../../voltmx_foundry_windows_install_guide/Content/Introduction.md).
*   Install Volt MX Analytics and Reporting. For more details, refer to the sections in the current guide (Volt MX Analytics and Reporting Installation Guide).

> **_Note:_** Volt MX Products support only Jasper Professional or Jasper Enterprise edition and not the community edition.
