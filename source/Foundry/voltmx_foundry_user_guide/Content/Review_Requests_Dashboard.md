## Review Requests Dashboard

With Governance, a new Review Requests menu appears in the Console sidebar (visible to Approvers and Admins) which allows to view all pending and closed publish requests. A publish request can be reviewed using the diff-viewer to inspect changes before approving or rejecting a request.
