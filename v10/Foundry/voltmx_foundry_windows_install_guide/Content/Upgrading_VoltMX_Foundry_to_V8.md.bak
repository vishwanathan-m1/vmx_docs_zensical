## Upgrading VoltMX Foundry using installer

This section explains upgrading VoltMX Foundry Components through the installer. 



The Installer does not support automatic backups of database and other artifacts. The Installer does not support rollback in case of a failure during the upgrade.  

 -  You must take backup of your database and other artifacts before upgrading.  

 -  After the upgrade, republish your VoltMX Foundry applications.

The **<Install Location\>** directory contains the log files documenting each invocation of the installer or uninstaller. To make problem identification easier, provide these log files to HCL when reporting an issue.

When you upgrade, the Installer detects the installed components from properties. The installer takes backup of the current install folder. The backed up folder is renamed with an underscore `_{previous_installed_version}`. The Installer validates the installed VoltMX Foundry components (for example: app server, database server and configuration.)

Based upon the type of installation you have, the upgrade procedure is two types.

*   Automated Installation (Single node, multi-node)

You need to upgrade VoltMX Foundry installation from the master node.

## Prerequisites

*   You can download the latest VoltMX Foundry Installer from [VoltMX Downloads](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/entitledDownloadFile.action?downloadPkgId=HCL_Volt_Foundry_v9.2.x&orgId=HCL&fromRecentFile=false&fromRecentPkg=true&fromDL=false) with your credentials.
*   Ensure that VoltMXFoundryInstaller.exe (x.x) file has execute permission.
*   This is hidden because through Installer, Upgrade to 7.1 is going with default tablespace USERS for all tablespace place holders hence we need to hide Oracle tablespace details.
*   In case you want to upgrade VoltMX Foundry to 7.1 on Oracle, upgrade Oracle schemas.<madcap:dropdown><madcap:dropdownhead>
